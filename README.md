Hello, DuckBear/Pannda here!
I'm here to talk about the project!

Application Info:
* the program only accepts .wav files (you can convert .mp3 to .wav online)
* Thread.Sleep() works in milliseconds, 1 millisecond is equal to 1,000 seconds
* the text box (label1) is unnecessary and does NOT need to be used

Instructions:
1. update the directory location in the code
2. place sound files into the Sound Files folder
   - any .wav file in there will be randomly selected
   - if you only put 1 file in the folder, that will be the only sound file played!
3. Windows Key + R (or search on your computer for RUN)
   - this opens the RUN application
4. type "shell:startup" into RUN and hit RETURN/ENTER
   - this should open a startup folder
5. grab the Sound Greetings application shortcut found in the Sound Greetings folder and move it to the Startup folder
   - you could create another shortcut of the shortcut then move one of those into the Startup folder if you wish
  
That's pretty much it really. I'm pretty sure there's more efficient ways to go about writing the code, but this is what I have been able to put together with my little bit of knowledge.
If anything outstanding approaches I'll make sure to update the files.


Where the project came from and what compelled me to make it:
- I seen an advertisement for the Ressha Melody Box, a music box that plays a nice noise when starting your car. I really liked the idea of it but I do not have a car to use the device in, but I do have a computer I've always wanted to acknowledge me. 
So I started making a plan for a physical device to hook up to the computer that would do the same thing; but I couldn't really think of how all components would work, so then I thought about making an application that could do the same task I wanted the box to do.
- The chime played at the start of the audio files was made by me in FLstudio, and the Japanese voices used were made on Narakeet.com, the voices used were Tomoka and Kaori.

Thank you for checking out the project/idea and thank you for reading!
I hope you enjoyed your stay with us :)
